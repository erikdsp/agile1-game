This was a group assignment, Okt 29th - Nov 1st, 2024 as part of our education at Chas Academy. The primary focus of the assignment was agile methods. Main objective to develop as a team using scrum and kanban. The task was to write a game in c++ for the console, Windows/OSX/Linux.

The game is based on the classic Connect 4 with a twist where the players can get BLAST cards that allows them to remove a tile from the game. The game does not yet implement the blast functionality.
